  ## Installation
  npm install

  ## Usage
  Open the file in VS Code. Through the Terminal, navigate into the Develop folder, and run "node index" to initialize the process. From there, you will be asked a series of questions that are required to be answered. Once you complete the series of questions, a beautiful, clean, and organized README file will be generated for you.
