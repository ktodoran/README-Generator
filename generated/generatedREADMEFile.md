  ## Installation
  npm install

  ## Usage
  Through the Terminal, navigate to the Develop folder, and first run npm install to ensure all the correct packages are installed. Next, run the node command to start the application. You will then be asked a series of questions that will be required to answer. Once all questions have been answered correctly, a clean and organized README file will be generated. You will then find that README file in the dist folder.
